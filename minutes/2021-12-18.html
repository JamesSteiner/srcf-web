<h2>Held on Jitsi Meet, to discuss:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Annual submission to Proctors</li>
  <li>The sysadmin mailbox/Mythic Beasts</li>
  <li>A term plan for Lent 2022</li>
</ul>
<h2>Present:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Patrick Connolly (<code>pc644</code>) &ndash; Treasurer</li>
  <li>Andrew Jenkins (<code>adj35</code>) &ndash; Secretary</li>
  <li>David Bai (<code>zb260</code>) &ndash; Publicity Officer</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="annual-submission">Annual submission</h2>
<p>
  This has not yet been done. Patrick to look at our accounts and fill out
  the list of officers. Andrew to email proctors and ask for an extension.
</p>
<h2 id="sysadmin-mailbox">Sysadmin mailbox</h2>
<p>
  No progress from the committee end as yet. Andrew to talk to sysadmins
  about the situation to establish whether anything had been arranged
  independently by the sysadmins.
</p>
<h2 id="LT2022">Lent 2022 Term Plan</h2>
<p> It should be our objective to get as many people involved as
  possible, in the interest of recruiting more sysadmins. The following
  ideas were proposed:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> An AGM (required) </li>
  <li> A visit to the Centre for Computing History </li>
  <li> One or two hack days </li>
  <li> A trip to the pub </li>
</ul>
<p> The possibility of a relaxed 'coffee and code' type event, which
  could be an easier way to get people involved than a hack day, was
  considered, but it was understood that this would represent quite a time
  commitment and it wasn't clear where we might do this while the SU lounge
  was not available for booking. </p>

<p> All agree to have a meeting in early January. </p>
