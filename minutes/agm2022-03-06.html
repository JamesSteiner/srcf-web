  <h3>Chair's report</h3>

<p>Following the 2020 EGM, there has been substantial consideration given to
the direction of the society. Since 2020, we have acquired some equipment and
lost Malcolm, our longstanding sysadmin and helper. It had been feared that the
club was losing relevance, but it has been good to see people appearing and
interest from first-years.</p>

<p>This year we've had a successful freshers' squash, one hackday which was
well-attended, and a social visit to the Center for Computing History. We've
experienced difficulties with retention but feel we're making progress, and
have recovered well from last year.</p>

<p> The challenges to be addressed are our impending relocation, and recruitment.
A volunteer form was created but there is substantial room for improvement in
following up contacts after they have expressed an interest.</p>

<h3> Treasurer's report</h3>
<p> The SRCF is in a stable financial position. Following a donation drive in
2020, a number of people have continued to give monthly donations. We also
recieved a donation from CUES (CU Engineering Society).</p>

<h3>Sysadmins' report</h3>
<p> The list of sysadmins has been trimmed again. Of the people on the list,
only a small minority are regularly active.</p>
<p> The servers have been upgraded from Ubuntu 16.04 to 20.04, shortly before
the former reached end-of-life (EoL). This was achieved with relatively little
disruption, but with one exception: the difficult decision had to be made to
shut down Timeout, our videoconferencing service.</p>
<p> At the time we set up Timeout, at the start of the pandemic, options for
university-aligned videoconferencing had been somewhat limited.
By 2021 there were relatively low user numbers and competitive alternatives
existed. BigBlueButton, the software it was based on, was quite poorly documented in
English, and it wasn't easy to hack on it. It depended quite heavily on Ubuntu
16.04 so we just couldn't keep it going once that version of Ubuntu reached
EoL.</p>
<p>There were some who had used Timeout a lot. It had been popular for events
and talks, and up to about a hundred attendees BBB was fine for that; with more
simultaneous viewers a streaming service would be more appropriate (and maybe
that's what a successor to Timeout should be, if we decide to establish one).</p> 
<p> In Michaelmas, we had a hackday that had a great turnout. We got started on
migrating mailing lists from Mailman 2 to 3 (which remains a work in
progress)</p>
<p>We're looking for ideas for things to do with donated hardware. 
On the software side, the sysadmins do have ideas on their wishlist (including
webhosting overhaul). To date there has been lots of thought, little action.
The need for recruitment is reiterated.</p>

<h3> Email </h3>
<p>The sysadmins used have a shared mailbox on Hermes, the University's mail
system. Hermes shut down at the end of 2021. Mythic Beasts had been considered
as a replacement  option (see minutes passim.), but in fact we have set up a mailbox
on some servers in the CL's data center. </p>
<p> Email is tricky to get right. Recently, mail sent from @srcf.net addresses
are beginning to 'get lost' by Gmail, marked as 'not validated' by SPF. It's
likely that in the near future we will need to change with the times and publish
an SPF policy, which we have not needed to do thus far. (EB currently sends mail
@srcf.net from his home server, but suspects this is not a common workflow).
</p>

<h3>On moving</h3>
<p>
Since its birth over two decades ago, the SRCF has lived with the SU, initially
in the Trumpington St offices, then the New Museums Site, then 17 Mill Lane. The
SU will be moving again in April, so we will need to move as well. With each
move, it has always been difficult to try to obtain adequate space.
</p>
<p>We are reminded of our longstanding relationship with the SU. In return for
the SU giving us space and power, the SRCF gives volunteer time to SU technical
assistance. Historically the SRCF has helped the SU with office IT, run a file
server, and helped keep their web-server going. It is our opinion that we are
still able to be useful to the SU even though some of their services are now
outsourced. It is noted that if in future the SU don't need or don't want our
help, then we may need to find a new home.
</p>
<p>
Discussions are in progress about space for us in the SU's new home in
University Centre. Whatever the outcome of these discussions, there will not be
adequate server space at the University Centre for at least 18 months, but some
space in the UIS offices at West Cambridge (the Main Equipment Room) is going to
be funded by the SU moving project. Discussion followed about how the move was
physically to be effected. (Since the AGM, the move has successfully been
carried out &ndash; you can read about it
<a href="https://blog.srcf.net/posts/move-west/">on the SRCF blog</a>).
