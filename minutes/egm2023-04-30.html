<h2>Background and discussion of the role</h2>
<p>The junior treasurer elected at the previous AGM resigned. Chair gives an
overview of the events ran by the society. For the previous year (2022-2023),
there was a fresher's squash to get people interested in open-source software
and a hackday was organised (although 2 were initially planned). A few years
prior a trip to the computing history museum was organised. Chair discusses the
challenges the incoming junior treasurer will face. The junior treasurer from
the previous committee (2022-2023) never setup the bank account and was removed
from the mandate. The 2021-2022 junior treasurer should be able to help
otherwise the senior treasurer, Bob Dowling, is on the mandate. This will need
to be resolved in addition to the de-registration of the society.</p>
<h2>Election of Junior Treasurer</h2>
<ol>
  <li>James Steiner nominates Matthew Blowers, seconded by Brychan Thomas</li>
  <li>Matthew Blowers is elected unanimously as Junior Treasurer.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Any other business</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Brychan Thomas reminds the (newly-formed) committee that the
      25th-anniversary dinner needs to be planned and in order to do that, an
      estimate of the attendance and cost needs to done. Perhaps one of the
      college would be an appropriate venue.</li>
  <li>Sunday 18th June 2023 is decided as the date of the next meeting when
      preliminary planning for the dinner will be done and to figure out the
      bank account.</li>
  <li>Brychan Thomas expresses interest in purchasing stash for the society.
    James Steiner points out the similarity in spelling between "scarf" and
    "SRCF".</li>
