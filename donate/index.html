          Since we provide everything for free, we heavily rely on the kind
          donations from our members. Please chip in
          if you like what we do or find our services valuable to you. Any donation goes a long way to securing the future of the SRCF for years to come.
        </p>
        <h5>Benefits</h5>
        <p>
          We intend to mention all donors on <a href="https://srcf.net/donors" target="_blank">our donors page</a>
          however the automation for this is currently broken. We're working to get it running again and intend to
          add historic donors we've missed so please include a note when you donate if you want to be anonymous.
        </p>
        <p>
          For cumulative donations (made in one-off or per-monthly donations) which amount to a value greater than
          £30, we intend to mention you in our message-of-the-day which is visible on our website and on login to
          our servers; implementing this is an ongoing project too.

    <p>
      The Cambridge University Student-Run Computing Facility (SRCF) is a
      volunteer-run provider of free, useful and flexible computing and
      networking services some of which include web hosting for 800+ groups,
      mailing lists, shell access, and a general sandbox for people interested
      in Linux/UNIX/BSD systems. It is the de-facto computer science and
      technology society and we are guided by the tenets of proper system
      administration and Free Open-Source Software.
    </p>

    <p>
      What we're working on (and where your money goes):
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>essential upkeep and maintenance of our hardware</li>
      <li>fixed costs such as the srcf.net domain</li>
      <li>upgrading the software running on its servers</li>
      <li>upgrading its 8+ year old servers and internals</li>
      <li>
        testing and launching various tools for society and group remote
        collaboration
      </li>
      <li>
        investigating many potential new services related to for example,
        software development
      </li>
      <li>training and social events, such as hackdays and outreach</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you are an <b>individual or a group </b>and you think what we do is
      cool, consider donating out of goodwill and shared passion for computing
      and technology. We stand on the shoulders of many giants, those originally
      involved in the Xen Project, for example, and we believe that we are a
      useful educational resource for both users and our system administrators.
      Thus, we have a duty to continue to show people what powers an
      increasingly important part of our daily lives and by supporting the SRCF,
      you can continue to guarantee that students get a first-hand look into
      many of the core tools and principles of today's tech world.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are a
      <b>company (or know one)</b> and are interested in partnering with or
      sponsoring us, we offer a
      <b
        >dedicated mailing list, a sponsors page and a chance to showcase your
        brand on our website</b
      >, which may be viewed by our 2500+ active users. We have in the past
      successfully provided employment opportunities to companies, as our users
      are likely to be familiar with Linux, networking, programming and related
      useful skills.

    <h4 class="card-title">Financial situation</h4>
    <h5 id="Income">Income</h5>
    <p>Since 2006, our donations have sharply fallen.</p>
    <div class="text-center">

        title="Total donations since 2006"
      />
    </div>
    <p>
      To put this into perspective, in 2018 when 9 members donated (higher than
      average), that amount is still not enough to cover over 2000 active
      monthly users and host 800+ group websites. As you can also see above,
      our donations fluctuate wildly and are generally decreasing, a model that
      is highly unsustainable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without any external help, the SRCF must rely on donations. It does not
      charge membership fees and likely never will.
    </p>

    <h5 id="Costs">Costs</h5>
    <p>
      The SRCF has fixed and dynamic costs, which it covers using its donation
      income.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Carrying on from 2019, our costs in only the last three months totaled
        around £400, making our current financial approach highly unsustainable.
      </li>
      <li>
        It has survived for so many years due to the expert knowledge of kind
        volunteers and generous donations. 20% of the SRCF’s current funds have
        come from one donation. Again, a model that is highly unsustainable.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hardware malfunctions and breaks down. These need to be replaced as soon
        as possible and require immediate access to funds. Without this, the
        SRCF’s services would be greatly degraded.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5 id="Limitations">Limitations</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The SRCF is looking to offer even more features and expand but cannot do
        so without additional funds.
      </li>
      <li>
        The SRCF needs a stable amount of reserves, as many other societies do,
        to recover in case of major damage to our systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Our reserves are presently not enough to cover for permanent damage to
        our equipment, ongoing maintenance and other costs we incur.

    </ul>

      FAQ
    </h4>
    <h5 id="Why-should-I-donate">Why should I donate?</h5>
    <p>
      The SRCF has been run by the goodwill of many sysadmin and committee
      volunteers over the last 20 years. Out of the three hosting options listed
      <a
        href="http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/committee/isss2/otherguidelines/wwwguidelines.html#Intro"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener"
        >here</a
      >, we are the only ones that remain. We dedicate lots of time to
      addressing security risks, ensuring regular upkeep, testing and launching
      new services and providing user support. We will always use your money to
      directly benefit our users and we would love to see the SRCF grow just as
      much as you do. Regular donations are the best way to accomplish this.
    </p>
    <h5 id="How-much-should-I-donate">Do you incur any processing fees?</h5>
    <p>
      Yes, the main consideration for us is processing fees. A high percentage
      of small (&lt;£3) donations is eaten by PayPal in processing fees. The
      fees that are applied to your donation are 3.4% + 0.2p.
    </p>
    <h6 id="I’m-a-group-account-administrator">
      What does this mean for my group account?
    </h6>
    <p>
      Your society or group may incurs costs, and so does ours. Web hosting is a fixed
      cost for companies around the world, so we recommend you set aside part of
      your budget (if you have one) for an annual donation to the SRCF. With direct access to the
      Cambridge University Data Network, a shell account, file storage, email,
      mailing lists, and so on it’s unlikely you’ll find a better deal than ours
      :)
      <strong>We recommend donating £50 or more.</strong>

      More information on finances
    </h4>
    <h5 id="Overview">Overview</h5>
    <p>Excluding outreach, SRCF funds can be split up into:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Emergency expenditure:</strong> replacement of failed hardware,
        essential maintenance
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Regular expenditure:</strong> “<a
          href="http://srcf.net"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          >srcf.net</a
        >” and other domains
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reserves:</strong> essential money kept aside as "insurance", it
        is used for emergencies such as severe water damage, theft, natural
        disasters, etc where our hardware is severly impacted.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>One-off expenditure:</strong> upgrades to our hardware, such as
        new servers
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The SRCF has at present <mark>no regular source of income</mark>. It
      instead relies on user donations which are highly variable in quantity and
      increasingly few. It also depends on server donations to keep it running.
    </p>
    <h5 id="State-of-finances">State of finances</h5>
    <p>
      The SRCF currently has just enough funds to cover its reserves and regular
      expenditure but lacks funds to finance immediate and one-off expenditures.

      A lot of the hardware is donated, which means the machines are old in the
      first place, so lack of upgrades brings a whole host of troubles: CPU
      vulnerabilities, loss of performance, power inefficiency, etc.
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-success">
      Worth noting that with further upgrades, maintenance costs fall as newer
      hardware is less likely to suffer as many failures.
